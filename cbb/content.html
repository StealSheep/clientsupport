            <ul>
              <li> Emotional contagion can occur when you mimic, usually without conscious effort, the
                emotions and expressions of people around you. </li>
              <li> Right now, the reality is that we still don't know what will happen next in
                financial markets. </li>
              <li> It's not easy to feel in control at the moment, but UBS Research has found that
                taking an active role in long-term financial planning actually reduces financial
                stress, and is empowering.</li>

      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p class="lead"> Just a month ago, we didn’t know whether western democracies’ unprecedented lockdowns would
          be
          sufficient to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Now, markets have risen sharply as investors
          have dared to look beyond the peak of the pandemic.</p>
        <p> Given that the central scenario laid out in last month’s Monthly Letter (in which new cases of
          the virus peaked by mid-April) is playing out as expected, in this letter we refresh our
          scenario analysis, and consider the next three phases of the coronavirus crisis so investors can
          evaluate the risks and opportunities that lie ahead. </p>
        <p> In the first phase, normalization, most of the US and Europe allow employees to return to work,
          but output remains well below pre-crisis levels. In the second phase, recovery, the economy
          gradually returns to pre-crisis levels. Net new business formation is positive, and workers made
          redundant during the lockdown find new positions. </p>
        <p> In the third, post-crisis phase, we are left with the legacy of the crisis: a world more
          indebted and less global, yet more digital. Despite the complexity of the three phases, and the
          wide range of possible outcomes, markets can only process a few key themes at a time, and, over
          the coming months, we think the market is likely to be driven primarily by: a) how quickly we
          can move through the normalization phase, and b) estimates of how far through the recovery phase
          we can get during 2021. </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote" style="background-color:seashell">

            what to do.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <h2 class="mt-4">Heading goes here</h2>
        <p> Our central scenario, in which intermittent lockdowns through 2020 mean that some broad recovery
          phase can only sustainably get underway in 2021, is already priced in by broad equity indexes.
          But there is no paucity of opportunity in markets today. We continue to believe that credit is
          cheaply priced relative to its risk, and we overweight US high yield and USD-denominated
          emerging market sovereign bonds in our US tactical asset allocation. Volatility remains
          elevated, providing investors the opportunity to gain asymmetric exposure to markets, or harvest
          yields. And within equities, we don’t think markets have yet fully appreciated the scale of
          structural change driven by the pandemic – with implications in particular for Digital
          Transformation, E-commerce, Fintech, Automation and Robotics, Healthtech, Genetic Therapies, and
          Oncology. </p>
        <p> The economic and social uncertainty created by this new virus is extraordinary. Massive
          government intervention in the economy means political decisions can now drive a much wider
          range of market outcomes. And central bank intervention in the bond markets makes
          diversification less straightforward than in the past. But, with a far-sighted financial plan,
          flexible enough to take advantage of opportunities, yet disciplined and diversified enough to
          stay the course, we remain convinced investors can both protect, and grow, capital over the long
          term. </p>
